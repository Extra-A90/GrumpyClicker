A cookie clicker like game that is game grumps themed using Discord's RPC



<h1>How to install????</h1>
<h3>Well you're gonna need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.Js</a> installed for this to work.
<br>
Once you have it installed you can click that green button in the top right of this screen that says "clone or download" and hit download zip.
<br>
Once you have the zip file extract the contents into a folder on your PC.
<br>
Once you have the folder with the file called "package.json" in it, open up a command prompt or terminal in that directory.
<br>
You can do this on windows by hitting the windows key and R at the same time and typing in "cmd" and hitting enter. Then you type "cd Desktop/folder_contents_are_in" into command prompt. (assuming you put the folder on your desktop)
<br>
Once you have done this type "npm install" into command propmpt.
<br>
Once that has finished you can simply type "npm start" into command prompt to play the game.

<h1>But how do I play?</h1>
<h3>Quite easy actually.
<br>
You simply click the GameGrumps logo over and over again to gain GrumpCoins.
<br>
But what are GrumpCoins?
<br>
GrumpCoins are essentially credits. With these "credits" you can buy GrumpHeads.
<br>
