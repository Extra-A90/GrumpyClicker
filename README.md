# GrumpyClicker
A cookie clicker like game that is game grumps themed using Discord's RPC



<h1>How to install????</h1>
<h3>Well you're gonna need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.Js</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed for this to work.

Once you have it installed you can click that green button in the top right of this screen that says "clone or download" and hit download zip.

Once you have the zip file extract the contents into a folder on your PC.

Once you have the folder with the file called "package.json" in it, open up a command prompt or terminal in that directory.

You can do this on windows by hitting the windows key and R at the same time and typing in `cmd` and hitting enter. Then you type `cd Desktop/folder_contents_are_in` into command prompt. (assuming you put the folder on your desktop)

Once you have done this type `npm install` into command propmpt.

Once that has finished you can simply type `npm start` into command prompt to play the game.
